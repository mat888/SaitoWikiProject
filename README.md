# SaitoWikiProject
Attempt at canonical source of information on Saito Consensus.

There are many talented authors who have written a decent volume of content outlining Saito Consensus in the few years since the project has been public. In the interest creating a rigorous and canonical source of information on Saito this Wiki (which will hopefully be incorporated into https://github.com/SaitoTech/wiki) without discarding the valuable work created thus far, this project is a call to the writers and thinkers of Saito to utilize existing writing and knowledge to collaboratively flesh out a relevant, organized, and modular knowledge center.

Consider each header as an article in the wiki, and the points below it sections. The corresponding files are organized into this repository - if you would like to contribute an article please be familiar with Saito Consensus and existing work describing it - use existing work if it fits and you have permission and be sure to cite it, but be sure that each article and section remains within it's topic.

The following is the basic structure:

---

## 1    - Bitcoin

### 1.1  - Overview of Bitcoin (as Economic Innovation)

1.12    - The Problems Bitcoin Solved

1.13  - Open & Sybil Resistant
